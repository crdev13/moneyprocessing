Money Processing Service
The test is to implement a light version of a bank processing service.
Just like a typical bank, it should have these entities:

Clients of the bank who keep money there.
Each Client can have multiple Accounts.
Each Account balance can be denominated in one currency.
For example Client1 can have three accounts: one USD account and two COP accounts.
The following currencies should be supported: USD, COP, MXN.

Transaction is an action to update an Account or Accounts balance.
A transaction should belong to one of following types:
● Deposit money
● Withdraw money
● Money transfer between Clients (Currency conversion is not needed. Only transfer
between accounts with the same currency is allowed.)

The following methods should be implemented:
● Create Client
● Create Account for Client
● Get Client
● Get Account
● Get Transactions - return list of transactions for account
● Create Transaction - create transaction of needed type

API - JSON via REST
Programming language - Golang
Database - PostgreSQL

Application should be packed to Docker image and uploaded to https://hub.docker.com/
Link to source code should be provided (open repository on github, bitbucket, gitlab)
